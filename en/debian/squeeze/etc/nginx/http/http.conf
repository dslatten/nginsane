# INDEX
# syntax:   
# default:  
# example:  
# context:  
# notes:
#   
#
index  index.html index.php;

# DEFAULT_TYPE
# syntax:   default_type %mime_type;
# default:  default_type text/plain;
# context:  http, server, location
# notes:
#   Defines a default MIME-type of a response. See also the types directive.
#
default_type  text/plain;

# LOG_FORMAT
# syntax:   log_format  %name  %string  ...;
# default:  log_format  combined  "...";
# context:  http
# notes:
#   Specifies format of a log.
#   The log format can contain common variables, and variables that exist only at the time of a log write:
#     $body_bytes_sent - the number of bytes sent to a client not counting the response header; this variable is compatible with the “%B” parameter of the mod_log_config Apache module
#     $bytes_sent - the number of bytes sent to a client
#     $connection - connection serial number
#     $connection_requests - the current number of requests made through a connection
#     $msec - time in seconds with a milliseconds resolution at the time of log write
#     $pipe - “p” if request was pipelined, “.” otherwise
#     $request_length - request length (including request line, header, and request body)
#     $request_time - request processing time in seconds with a milliseconds resolution; time elapsed between the first bytes were read from the client and the log write after the last bytes were sent to the client
#     $status - response status
#     $time_iso8601 - local time in the ISO 8601 standard format
#     $time_local - local time in the Common Log Format
#
log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                  '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                  '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

# ACCESS_LOG
# syntax:   access_log  %path  [%format [buffer = %size]];
# default:  access_log  logs/access.log  combined;
# context:  http, server, location, if in location, limit_except
# notes:
#   Sets the path, format, and buffer size for the buffered log writes. Several logs can be specified on the same level. The special value off cancels all access_log directives on the current level. If format is not specified then the predefined format “combined” is used.
#   The buffer size must not exceed the size of the atomic write to a disk file. For FreeBSD 3.0-6.0 this size is unlimited.
